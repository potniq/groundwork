  "tips": "For business travelers: (1) Plan commute with 1-hour buffer for potential subway delays; arrive 10-15 minutes early to meetings. (2) Subway is fastest and most reliable during peak hours (8-10am, 4-7pm) when traffic gridlocks taxis and rideshares. (3) Use OMNY contactless payment or MetroCard for seamless transit. (4) For airport arrival with luggage, consider AirTrain + subway ($10.25 total) over Uber ($60) to save costs. (5) Key business districts: Midtown (offices, conference centers, Grand Central/Penn Station), Financial District (Wall Street, WTC), Chelsea (creative vibe, Penn Station access). (6) Walking is often faster for short distances. (7) Avoid relying on taxis/rideshares due to cost and traffic; use subway for efficiency. (8) Download CityMapper app for real-time transit planning and commute tracking."
